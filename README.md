## Week 1: Project Selection and Initial Literature Survey
- Define project scope and goals
- Research relevant literature
- Research existing solutions

## Week 2: Project Setup and Project Management
- Organize dataset and data loading
- Set up project repository and collaboration tools
- Images preprocessing literature review

## Week 3: Data Preprocessing and EDA
- Apply data augmentation techniques
- Preprocessing (images resizing, normalization, etc.)
- Verify preprocessing steps

## Week 4: Model Selection and Design
- Design architecture of a CNN model and implement a baseline model
- Design architecture of a CNN model and implement a baseline model
- Design architecture of a CNN model and implement a baseline model

## Week 5: Model Improvement and Transfer Learning
- Load and configure a pretrained model (VGG-16, etc.)
- Fine-tune the pretrained model on the knew x-ray dataset
- Compare results of the improved models against the baseline

## Week 6: Model Analysis and Optimization
- Set up hyper-parameter tuning (grid search, random search)
- Optimize training process (learning rate, batch size)
- Conduct hyper-parameter tuning experiments

## Week 7: Model Evaluation and Deployment
- Evaluate final model on validation and test sets
- Implement model performance metrics
- Prepare project report and presentation
